Hello visitor!

Welcome to <b>Nagarajan</b>'s website. I am a programmer with an affinity towards web apps, Python, Javascript and applied mathematics. I also greatly enjoy the works of Douglas Adams and Monty Python (you probably got that from the title - a portmanteaux from their works).

On this blog, you will find some random thoughts, ramblings and explorations that I found interesting and had the time/inclination to pen them down. Its a mish-mash of Maths, Physics, Puzzles, History and Programming.

I hope you too find them interesting and possibly useful. On the right sidebar (or below, if you are on mobile), you can find links to some interesting content on the web.

Enjoy!
