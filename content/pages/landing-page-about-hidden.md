Hi visitor... welcome to <b>Nagarajan</b>'s website. I am a programmer with an affinity towards Web apps, Python, Javascript and Applied Mathematics. I also greatly enjoy the works of Douglas Adams and Monty Python (title of this page is a portmanteaux from their works).

Here you will find some random thoughts, ramblings and explorations that I found interesting and had the time/inclination to pen them down. Its a mish-mash of Maths, Physics, Puzzles, History and Programming.

I hope you too find them interesting and possibly useful. On the right sidebar, you can also find links to some interesting content on the web.

Would love to hear any feedback - there is a comment section at the bottom of each page.

Enjoy!
