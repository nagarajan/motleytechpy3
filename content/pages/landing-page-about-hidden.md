Hello visitor!

Welcome to MotleyTech, a mish-mash of selected topics from Maths, Physics, Puzzles, History and Programming - a random assortment of things that I found interesting and had the time & inclination to pen down.

I hope you too find them interesting and possibly useful. You can also find links to a few other interesting things in the right sidebar (or below, in case of small width screens).

Enjoy!
