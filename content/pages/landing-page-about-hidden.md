Hello visitor!

Welcome to <b>Nagarajan</b>'s website. I am a programmer with an affinity towards web apps, Python, Javascript and applied mathematics. I also greatly enjoy the works of Douglas Adams and Monty Python (you probably got that from the title - a portmanteaux from their works).

This blog is a mish-mash of selected topics from Maths, Physics, Puzzles, History and Programming - a random assortment of things I found interesting and I had the time/inclination to pen down.

I hope you too find them interesting and possibly useful. You can also find links to a few other interesting things on the right sidebar (or below, if you are on mobile).

Enjoy!
