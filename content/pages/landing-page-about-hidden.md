Hello visitor!

Welcome to MotleyTech - my personal blog/website. This blog is a mish-mash of selected topics from Maths, Physics, Puzzles, History and Programming - a random assortment of things I found interesting and I had the time/inclination to pen down.

I hope you too find them interesting and possibly useful. You can also find links to a few other interesting things in the right sidebar (or below, if you are on mobile).

Enjoy!

<i>About me</i>: My name is <b>Nagarajan</b>, and I am a programmer with an affinity towards web apps, Python, Javascript and applied mathematics. I also greatly enjoy the works of Douglas Adams and Monty Python (you probably got that from the title - a portmanteaux from their works). I currently (late 2021) work as a programmer in the SF Bay Area. I can be contacted at '<i>nag dot rajan at gmail dot com</i>'.
