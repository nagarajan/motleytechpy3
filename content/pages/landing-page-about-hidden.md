Hello visitor!

Welcome to MotleyTech, a mish-mash of selected topics from Maths, Physics, Puzzles, History and Programming - a random assortment of things that I find interesting and had the time & inclination to pen down.

I hope you too find them interesting and possibly useful. Additionally, you can also find links to a few external distractions in the "Other distractions" section...

Enjoy!
